    # Future self raghavTinker:
    # The deletion is essentially a soft delete. Basically the record will have all of its field changed to " " as seen in the payload

    # Also as for the googleDrive delete. If the file isnt owned by the user the deletion function will exit gracefully and the record will still be wiped
